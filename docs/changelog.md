## Version History Overview

### Semantic Versioning Guide

This project follows semantic versioning (SemVer):

- **MAJOR** version increments indicate incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** version increments add functionality in a backward compatible manner  
- **PATCH** version increments include backward compatible bug fixes

### Release Cadence

- **Major releases**: Every 6-12 months (when significant breaking changes accumulate)
- **Minor releases**: Every 1-2 months (for new features and enhancements)
- **Patch releases**: As needed (for critical bug fixes and security updates)

### Deprecation Policy

- Features marked as deprecated will be supported for at least one major version
- Deprecation warnings will be included in the release notes
- Migration guides will be provided for breaking changes

### Breaking Changes
