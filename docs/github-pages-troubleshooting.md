# GitHub Pages Deployment Troubleshooting

## Issue: Concurrent Deployment Error

You encountered this error:
```
Deployment request failed for [build-id] due to in progress deployment. Please cancel [deployment-id] first or wait for it to complete.
```

## What We Fixed

### 1. Added Concurrency Control
We added this to the workflow to prevent multiple deployments:

```yaml
concurrency:
  group: "pages"
  cancel-in-progress: false
```

This ensures only one Pages deployment runs at a time.

### 2. Added Timeout and Error Handling
- Added 10-minute timeout for deployments
- Added wait step to avoid conflicts
- Improved error handling

## Manual Solutions (if the issue persists)

### Option 1: Wait for Completion
Simply wait 10-15 minutes for the in-progress deployment to complete, then re-run the failed workflow.

### Option 2: Cancel via GitHub UI
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Navigate to Settings → Pages
3. If there's a deployment in progress, you may see an option to cancel it
4. Cancel the deployment and re-run your workflow

### Option 3: Use GitHub CLI (if available)
```bash
# List active deployments
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/deployments --paginate

# Cancel a specific deployment (replace DEPLOYMENT_ID)
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/deployments/DEPLOYMENT_ID/statuses \
  -X POST \
  -F state=inactive \
  -F description="Cancelled due to conflict"
```

### Option 4: Force Push to Trigger New Deployment
```bash
# Make a small change and force push
git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger new Pages deployment"
git push
```

## Prevention

The concurrency control we added should prevent this issue going forward. The workflow will now:
1. Queue deployments instead of running them in parallel
2. Wait for previous deployments to complete
3. Handle timeouts gracefully

## Monitoring

You can monitor your GitHub Pages deployments at:
- `https://github.com/jpoullet2000/egile-mcp-client/deployments`
- Repository Settings → Pages

## If the Problem Persists

If you continue seeing this error after our fixes:

1. Check if there are multiple workflows trying to deploy to Pages
2. Verify GitHub Pages is enabled in repository settings
3. Check if there are any GitHub service outages
4. Consider using a different branch for Pages deployment temporarily

The fixed workflow should resolve the concurrent deployment issue automatically.
